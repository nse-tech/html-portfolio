<H2>My Top three Horror Movies for 2023</H2>
<hr />
<h3>The NUN II</h3>
<p>The Nun II is a sequel of the Nun I produced by the conjuring Universal. The movie was shot in an all-girls catholic school, the demon Valak had possessd a young handyman who works at the school. A reverend sister was sent to the school to exorcise them. In the movie we could see glimpse of certain scenes from the conjuring II and how Valak was introduced to it. It was the best horror movie for 2023 and it most definitely will have a new release which will most likely be a prequel</p>

<h3>Saw X</h3>
<p>Saw X is a really interesting movie with gory scenes, it has nothing to do with the paranormal entities genre kind of horror movies. This movie was a prequel shot before the demise of Jigsaw. He had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was advised that there was a cure for it, after spending his life savings on it, turns out it was all a scam. Upon realising that he has been conned, Jigsaw decided to make them pay. It was an interesting watch.</p>

<h3>The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
<p>In a small town, a boy has been possessed by a demon and a Pope was sent to the family to exorcised the boy. It was a difficult exorcism because the demon could use your weakness against you.</p>
